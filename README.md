# RPEN V2 – Transmitter ✨

The **Transmitter** is the pen module of the RPEN V2 project.  
It captures motion, user input, and configuration data, then transmits them wirelessly to the **Receiver**, which renders the drawing on a screen.

## Features

- **Motion Sensing:** High-performance IMU for smooth and precise tracking.  
- **User Controls:** Buttons to change mode, size, or color.  
- **Feedback System:** RGB LEDs (and future haptics) to provide real-time feedback.  
- **Wireless Communication:** Sends data frames (motion, size, color, mode) to the Receiver with low latency.  

## Planned Improvements

- Better noise filtering and calibration.  
- Stronger microcontroller for improved responsiveness.  
- More ergonomic design for user comfort.  

## Roadmap

- [ ] Finalize hardware component selection.  
- [ ] Develop data frame protocol.  
- [ ] Implement advanced filtering algorithms.  
- [ ] Synchronize with the Receiver module.
